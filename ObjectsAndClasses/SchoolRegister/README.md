## School Register

### Description
    In this problem, you have to arrange all students by grade. You as the secretary of the school principal will process students and store them into a school register 
    before the new school year hits. As a draft, you have a list of all the students from last year but mixed. 
    Keep in mind that if a student has a lower score than 3, he does not go into the next class. 
    As a result of your work, you have to print the entire school register sorted in ascending order by grade already filled 
    with all the students from last year in the format:
    `{nextGrade} Grade
    List of students: {All students in that grade}
    Average annual score from last year: {average annual score on the entire class from last year}`
    And empty row {console.log}
    The input will be an array with strings, each containing a student's name, last year's grade, and an annual score. 
    The average annual score from last year should be formatted to the second decimal point.
