# JS Front-End

## Towns

### Description
    Youâ€™re tasked to create and print objects from a text table. 
    You will receive the input as an array of strings, where each string represents a table row, with values on the row separated by pipes " | " and spaces.
    The table will consist of exactly 3 columns "Town", "Latitude" and "Longitude". The latitude and longitude columns will always contain valid numbers.
    The output should be objects. Latitude and longitude must be parsed to numbers and formatted to the second decimal point!
