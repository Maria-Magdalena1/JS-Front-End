# JS Front-End

## Sections

### Description

    You are given a webpage with a form containing a text input and a submit button. When the form is submitted, split the input value by ", " and use each resulting string to create a section.
    Each section must be a <div> containing a hidden <p> element with the section title. When the <div> is clicked, the paragraph should become visible.
    Append all generated sections to the element with id="content".
