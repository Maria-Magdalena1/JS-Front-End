## Sudomu

### Description

    Write a function that implements SUDOMU (Sudoku inside the DOM).
    If the table is filled with the right numbers, and the ["Quick Check"] button is clicked
    The table borer should be changed to: "2px solid green". The text content of the paragraph
    inside the div with an id "check" must be "Success!"
    Otherwise, when the filled table does not solve the sudomu
    The table border should be changed to: "2px solid red". The text content of the paragraph inside the div 
    with an id "check" must be: "Keep trying..." 
    The ["Clear"] button clears the whole SUDOMU (removes all numbers) and the paragraph
    which contains the messages.
